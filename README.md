Analyzing Kickstarter data for maximizing the amount of money raised by an upcoming board game campaign

I have reviewed the Kickstarter data provided, which was composed of information regarding 15,000 campaigns between the years 2009-2018. I have analyzed the data with the aim of maximizing the amount of money raised by the companyâ€™s upcoming board game campaign. I have used MySQL to explore the data and Python (with packages pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scipy) to visualize and analyze it.

### Files:

* `all_data.csv` - Dataset used for analysis, prepared and exported via the code in `sql_script.sql` file
* `report.pdf` - Business report of the analysis
* `sql_script.sql` - SQL code used to explore the dataset and export the `all_data.csv` file to visualize and analyze the data in Python
* `visualization_and_analysis.csv` - Python code for visualization and analysis of the dataset
